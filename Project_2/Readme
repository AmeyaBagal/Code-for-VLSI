The mac.bsv file used here is the same as the unpipelined submission of the Project 1.

We made two more modules, one for an individual systolic cell (syst_cell.bsv) which takes in 16-bit inputs A and B, 1-bit input S to decide which kind of operation
bf16 multiplication or int32 addtion the cell has to carry out.

For the first row of systolic cells in the systolic array, the C input inputs of the MAC unit are initialized to Bit#(32) 'b0.
The MAC output of the first row of cells is given as the C input of the respective vertically below systolic cell.
The A input of the systolic cell is transferred horizontally in a row for every clock cycle.
